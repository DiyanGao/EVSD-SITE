  <h2> Almost done! The final step is the EVSD Annual Contribution.</h2>
  <h4 class="page-header">Payment Information</h4>

  <blockquote>EVSD Annual Contribution: $250
  <br>
          As reviewed in the Parent Orientation, this is the bare minimum we need to cover coaching expenses and salaries, facilities, school tournament fees, club events, financial aid & subsidies to students, league fees, professional material, and much more.
          Most schools ask for around $400-$600, so we are trying our best to do with as little aid as possible. Please contact team administration at evhs.sd@gmail.com for questions or concerns.
          We use Paypal and Stripe software to power our payment process, which means our platform is verified and 100% safe. Because we are a registered 501c3 under California State Government and an ESUHSD Booster, your contribution is tax-deductible.
