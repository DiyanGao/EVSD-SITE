	<h4><a name=parli>Parliamentary Debate</a></h4>
	<p class="flow-text" style="font-size:14px">EVSD boasts the single most successful Parliamentary Debate program in the nation, being nationally ranked at #1 for the 2015-2016 season. Parliamentary debate (or parli) is one of the more extemporaneous Speech & Debate events. Unlike other forms of debate, such as Public Forum and Lincoln-Douglas, you are only given 20 minutes to prep out a case. Parliamentary debate is a partner-based event that requires a mix of the ability to think quickly and a good amount of speaking prowess. Topics are assigned at random and are left to the debaters to come up with a fair and acceptable interpretation. Evergreen Valley Speech & Debate has recently had a lot of success in Parliamentary Debate with some of our teams breaking to outrounds at Stanford, James Logan, and Santa Clara; it is the perfect event for students who might not necessarily have a lot of time to work on a debate case and want to gain content knowledge on a wide variety of subjects that effect our world today.</p>

	<h4><a name="LD">Lincoln Douglas Debate</a></h4>
	<p class="flow-text" style="font-size:14px">Lincoln-Douglas debate (LD debate) is a one-on-one debate event that focuses on ethical issues. The resolutions are moral statements whose truth values are debated by the affirmative, who argues that the resolution is true, and the negative, who argues that the resolution is false. Examples of recent resolutions include: "A government has the obligation to lessen the economic gap between its rich and poor citizens", "Individuals have a moral obligation to assist people in need", and "States ought not possess nuclear weapons". Unlike other forms of debate, LD relies heavily on philosophy (especially moral and political philosophy), good empirical data, and logical analysis. Debates will often involve a clash between two competing philosophical or political positions.
	In recent years, LD debate has also begun to absorb elements of Policy Debate. This has introduced many more forms of argumentation into LD debate, including plans, counterplans, disadvantages, topicality, theory and kritiks, but these arguments are only present in more advanced levels of LD debate. Due to the introduction of Policy style arguments, the LD debate metagame has largely diverged into two major formats: "lay LD", which focuses more on persuasion, appealing to a wider audience, speaking skills, value debate, and emotional responses, and "circuit LD", which focuses more on fast delivery, Policy style arguments, a more theoretical outlook on debate, and a more demanding research burden.
	No matter which format, LD debate helps provide students with a deeper understanding of both sides of important issues, such as animal rights and universal health care, knowledge of crucial philosophical questions, greater analytical and refutation abilities, greater public speaking skills, and ultimately the critical thinking skills needed to succeed in the 21st century.</p>
