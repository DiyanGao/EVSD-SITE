		<ol>
			<li>State and national award winners have a 22% to 30% higher acceptance rate at top tier colleges.</li>

			<li>This is significantly better than other extracurricular activities that tend to recruit from the same pool of students as forensic teams such as school newspaper reporter (+3%), sports team captain (+5%), class president (+5%), and band (+3%).</li>
