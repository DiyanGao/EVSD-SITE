	<h1>EVSD Judge Rules</h1>
	<p>Every tournament EVSD attends requires us to provide a number of judges proportional to the number of students we enter in that tournament. Our judges then judge students from other schools while judges provided by other schools judge our students. </p>
	<p><b>Tournaments with student-provided judges</b></p>
	<p>At most tournaments we attend, providing judges is the responsibility of each individual entry attending the tournament. An ‘entry’ is defined as an IE (non-Duo speech) or LD competitor or as a Duo or Parli or PF partnership. Each entry must list the name of a judge covering their obligation. Putting down the judge’s name means committing that the judge would be available for the entire duration of the tournament.</p>
	<p>Your judge can be anyone who is over 18, has a high school diploma, and understands English. This can be a parent, an older sibling, a friend, or someone you personally hired to judge for you.</p>
	<p>Competitors are REQUIRED to provide judges per these conditions:</p>
		<br>
	<p>1-day tournaments:</p>
	<p>Parli, PF, and Duo teams are responsible for providing a full-day judge</p>
	<p>LD and IE competitors are responsible for providing a half-day judge</p>
		<br>
	<p>Multi-day tournaments:</p>
	<p>Parli, PF, and Duo teams are responsible for providing a judge for all days that their events have rounds (including elimination rounds).</p>
	<p>LD and IE competitors are responsible for providing a one-day judge.</p>
		<br>
	<p>Exceptions to these rules may be announced on a tournament-by-tournament basis.</p>
	<p>If you enter in more than one event, you will get a separate judge obligation for each event.</p>	
	<p>If your judge is not committed for the entire tournament, you will be informed prior to the tournament which shift (morning or afternoon for one-day tournaments and Friday or Saturday or Sunday for multi-day tournaments) your judge is assigned. Your judge is responsible for covering the shift that they are assigned. If they prefer a different shift, it is their responsibility to find an EVSD judge who has that shift and agrees to swap with them. All judge swaps must be reported to the club leadership.</p>
		<br>
	<p><b>Judge buy-out </b></p>
	<p>You can request to pay a judge buy-out fee instead of providing a judge. To make the request, type ‘I will pay’ instead of entering a judge name. It is not guaranteed that the request is granted. </p>
	<p>The cost of buying out a one-day judge commitment is $120</p>
	<p>The cost of buying out a half-day judge commitment is $60</p>
	<p><b>Judge drop</b></p>
	<p>Once you enter a judge name when registering for a tournament, that judge is obligated to attend. Tournaments drop our entries - not just you, but other people as well - if our judges don’t show up. Your judge obligation is finalized at the time of the EVSD  tournament registration deadline. If you drop after that deadline, your judge is still obligated to attend.</p>
	<p>If you request to buy out a judge when registering for a tournament and your request is granted, you may attend the tournament. But if you put down a judge name, and then that judge drops after the tournament registration deadline, you will both have to pay the judge buy-out fee and be dropped from the tournament.</p>
	<p>If your judge comes to the tournament, but misses a round, you will be charged a $20 nuisance fee per round missed. In addition, you will be responsible for paying any fines the tournament charges EVSD as a result of your judge missing any rounds.</p>
	<p><b>Tournaments with club-provided judges</b></p>
	<p>Some tournaments do not allow parent judges. For these tournaments, EVSD will hire professional judges to cover our judging obligation, and will split the costs of these judges equally among all competitors attending the tournament. Competitors will thus be expected to pay both the entry fees and the judge costs. The exact judge costs may not be known ahead of time. Tournaments with club-provided judges include (but are not necessarily limited to):</p>
