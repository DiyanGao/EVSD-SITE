	<h1>Reimbursement Procedure</h1>
	<p>If you make a payment on behalf of EVSD, please save the receipt, scan it, and email it to evhs.sd@gmail.com . </p>
	<p>The subject line should read "Reimbursement - [Student Name (First Last)]."</p>
	<p>The body of the email should include the dollar amount to be reimbursed, the name of the person who the check should be written out to, and the address to which the check should be mailed.</p>
	<p>We cannot guarantee reimbursements if we do not receive the receipt.</p>
	<p>Amounts smaller than $50 will go toward your future tournament credit, and will be reimbursed at the end of the season if you have an overall positive balance. If you paid more than $50 and want it to go toward your future tournament credit, please indicate so in the receipt email. If your current balance is negative, your reimbursement will go toward covering the money you owe.</p>
