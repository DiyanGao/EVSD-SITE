	<h1>EVSD Nuisance Fee Policy</h1>
	<p>The EVSD Nuisance Fee is $20.</p>
	<p><b>The fee is levied for:</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Dropping from a tournament after the EVSD registration deadline for that tournament</li>
		<li>Skipping a tournament round</li>
		<li>Leaving a tournament without being signed out by an adult</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Failure to pay the fee will make you ineligible to attend future tournaments</p>
	<p>Paying the Nuisance Fee to EVSD does not exempt you from paying any fees the tournament may charge the club due to your behavior. </p>
	<p>If you have a serious and legitimate excuse, the Nuisance Fee may waived at the discretion of the club leadership.</p>
	<p>If a tournament charges a drop fee equal to or larger than $20 (on top of not defunding the entry fee), the EVSD nuisance fee for dropping will be waived. </p>
	<ol>
		<li><b>Dropping from a tournament after our deadline</b></li>
		<p>Dropping students from tournaments after the deadline hurts our club's reputation not only with the tournament directors and facilitators, but also with other schools. Tournaments will often already have pairings and rounds ready to go ahead of time, so your drop will force both our club officers and the tournament organizers to do extra work.</p>
		<p>To drop from a tournament, use the Tournament Drop form</p>
		<li><b>Skipping a round</b></li>
		<p>Skipping a round reflects negatively on our program. No-shows make life difficult for the tournament directors and cause them to become less cooperative with us in the future. A no-show also results in an automatic win for the other student(s) in your round and thus gives the clubs we compete with an advantage over us. Please be sure to go to all rounds you sign up for.</p>
		<li><b>Leaving without being signed out</b></li>
		<p>It is imperative for the safety of all students that you do not leave the campus on which the tournament is being held without being accompanied by an adult and without that adult signing you out with the tournament chaperon. Please see our "Tournament Procedure" document for specific instructions about signing out. If you do not sign out, then our coaches have to stay at the tournament, sometimes until early morning hours, making sure you are safe.</p>
